Dataduct
========

    Dataduct - DataPipeline for humans

`Dataduct <https://github.com/coursera/dataduct>`__ is a wrapper built
on top of `AWS
Datapipeline <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/datapipeline/latest/DeveloperGuide/what-is-datapipeline.html>`__
which makes it easy to create ETL jobs. All jobs can be specified as a
series of steps in a YAML file and would automatically be translated
into datapipeline with appropriate pipeline objects.

Features include:

- Visualizing pipeline activities
- Extracting data from different sources such as RDS, S3, local files
- Transforming data using EC2 and EMR
- Loading data into redshift
- Transforming data inside redshift
- QA data between the source system and warehouse

It is easy to create custom steps to augment the DSL as per the
requirements. As well as running a backfill with the command line
interface.
