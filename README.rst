Dataduct |build-status| |coverage-status|
-----------------------------------------
Dataduct is a wrapper built on top of AWS Datapipeline which makes it easy to
create ETL jobs. All jobs can be specified as a series of steps in a YAML file
and would automatically be translated into datapipeline with appropriate
pipeline objects.
